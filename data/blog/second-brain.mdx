## Second brain

Few weeks ago [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnE7c0ELEH8) popped up in my recommendations, curious me clicked on it and watched the first 2-3 minutes of it.
Also thanks to that video i got to see how powerful Obsidian is.

In that initial part of the video Chuck talks about a book named ```Building a second Brain``` by ```Tiago Forte```, that raised my curiosity again and after reading more about the book, I bought it.

I have read the first chapters, Tiago Forte's story is quite interesting and its motivation behind building a second brain makes sense. Since then, i have started to implement these notes into my own daily life.

From now on, I always carry a small notebook and a pen with me so I can just write down my thoughts or ideas and later when I have free time develop or scratch them. Also I have realised is important to separate your thoughts into what i am going to call knowledge blocks.

Let me explain what i refer with different knowledge blocks. For me a knowledge block is a system either physical or digital that acts as a part of the second brain. Depending on my intention and focus, I would decide whether to do it physically or digitally. For example, my technical notes or thoughts about books or non very personal things go to digital. My own personal thoughts and intimate stuff goes to physical blocks.

I started taking digital notes through obsidian, it is an amazing tool that I just started using recently. I used to use Notion but personally I prefer to use and support free open source technologies. Nothing bad against Notion, I just dont like the idea of hosting my notes in a proprietary company that might decide to sell my data or use it to train LLMs.

The interesting part about obsidian is how flexible it is, there are dozens of community made plugins that expand its capabilities. In combination of obsidian, I recently found out as well about quartz.

This is a web application that sums up your notes into a powerful web-based app with a knowledge graph similar to what I have in the tags section of this website.

In order to deploy quartz, I went for a very simple method, a CI/CD pipeline on GitHub Actions that deploys to Github Pages. Since I am going to be updating it very often I did not want to have to store lots of Docker Images and wait for them to build and wait for my portainer setup to update them.

Another building block that I have apart of the thoughts notebook and quartz. I started to write about my reflections in a separate notebook, this turned out to be quite beneficial for my mental health and I recommend everyone to try it.
