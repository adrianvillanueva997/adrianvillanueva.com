## Second brain

Few weeks ago [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnE7c0ELEH8) popped up in my recommendations, curious me clicked on it and watched the first 2-3 minutes of it.
Personally I did not care about the pipeline of the blog or anything. Just wanted to see the reason he wanted to create it.

In that initial part of the video Chuck talks about a book named ```Building a second Brain``` by ```Tiago Forte```, that raised my curiosity again and after reading more about the book, I bought it.
