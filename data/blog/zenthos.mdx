## 🌱 The Motivation

Hydroponics, growing plants without soil, opens the door to fully automated, self-sustaining agricultural systems. But most “smart garden” setups today are just toys.

I wanted more:

- Real-time observability
- Robust data pipelines
- Scalable backend
- OTA updates
- Embedded ML on the edge
- Automation

Enter the **ESP32** family.

### 🔍 The Discovery

I had previously worked with Raspberry Pi and Arduino before, but the ESP32 ecosystem felt different: cheaper, more powerful, and purpose-built for IoT. After testing several variants:

- `ESP32-S3`: with vector instructions and AI acceleration.
- `ESP32-CAM`:for image capture and edge CV.
- `ESP32 with OLED`: for simple UX/display at the edge.

<Callout type="note">
I saw the potential for a **clean, modular system**, that can be powered by Rust, traced with OTEL, monitored end-to-end and with the option to integrate some MLOPS / FirmwareOps.
</Callout>

### 🏆 The goal

The end goal is to build a full hydroponics system, but for now, we will start with something simpler.

- Exploring Rust for embedded devices.
- Integration of OTA server and full control of FirmwareOps.
- Platform monitoring.
- Integration with a data and analytics platform.
- Monetization.

## 🚧 What’s Next

Over the next few weeks I’ll be expanding this system:

<TechStack technologies={["Rust", "ESP32", "MQTT", "RabbitMQ", "PostgreSQL", "OpenTelemetry", "Grafana", "Prometheus", "MLflow", "Redis", "Axum"]} />

- Add OTA server in Axum + Redis.
- Full MLOps pipeline with edge inferencing.
- Monitor power, water, and nutrient sensors.
- Weather station.
- Automatic adjustments (fan, light, water pump).
- Real-world testing with real plants.

## 🔚 Final Thought

Zenthos is my commitment to full-stack, edge intelligence.
If you're building in this space, let's talk! I want to hear your thoughts.

I will expand about the architecture in the next post.
