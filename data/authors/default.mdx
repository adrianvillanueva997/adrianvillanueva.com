## Philosophy & Approach

I believe in building systems that are resilient, elegant, and meaningful. My approach focuses on:

- **Simplicity over complexity** - Choose the right tool for the job
- **Developer experience** - Make platforms that teams love to use
- **Sustainable architecture** - Build for the long term
- **Continuous learning** - Technology evolves, so do I

## Current Interests

**Research Areas**: Audio synthesis â€¢ AI agents â€¢ Rust systems programming â€¢ Self-hosted infrastructure

**Languages**: Spanish (native) â€¢ English (professional) â€¢ Japanese (learning) â€¢ Dutch (basic)

**Beyond Code**: When I'm not building data platforms, you'll find me creating music - from synthwave to experimental electronic sounds. Code and music share the same DNA: structure, rhythm, and creative expression.

## Let's Build Something

Currently focused on data mesh architectures and MLOps platforms. Always interested in collaborating on projects that push the boundaries of what's possible.

*Ready to turn ideas into reality.*
