# I design systems with soul — in code, in sound, in silence

I’m Adrian Villanueva Martinez, a software engineer, artist, and expat currently based in Japan. I build scalable infrastructure for machine learning, craft expressive code in Rust and Python, and explore the intersection between data, sound, and embodied experience.

Originally from Spain, I work across Europe and Asia blending engineering precision with artistic depth.

## 🌀 Working Philosophy

> _“Resilience in architecture. Elegance in code. Meaning in structure.”_

I believe software is more than just tools, it's ritual, rhythm, and responsibility. My systems are designed to scale, to last, and to honor the flow between logic and intuition.

## 🖤 A Little More Human

By day, I build pipelines.
By night, I channel frequencies.
I believe darkness is not the absence of light, it's the space that gives it meaning.

I’m always down to build, break, and begin again.
