# I design systems with soul — in code, in sound, in silence

I’m Adrian Villanueva Martinez, a software engineer, artist, and expat currently based in Japan. I build scalable infrastructure for machine learning, craft expressive code in Rust and Python, and explore the intersection between data, sound, and embodied experience.

Originally from Spain, I work across Europe and Asia blending engineering precision with artistic depth.

## 🌀 Working Philosophy

> _“Resilience in architecture. Elegance in code. Meaning in structure.”_

I believe software is more than just tools, it's ritual, rhythm, and responsibility. My systems are designed to scale, to last, and to honor the flow between logic and intuition.

- Simplicity over complexity
- Speed over bureaucracy
- Taste over trend
- Rust where it matters, Python where it moves

I dislike Kubernetes bloat. I build fast, scalable systems that stay maintainable

## 🎯 Currently Exploring

- DAWs, different synthesizers and instruments
- LLM agents and integrations
- Rust
- Systems, self hosting and observability

## 🖤 A Little More Human

By day, I build pipelines.
By night, I channel frequencies.
I believe darkness is not the absence of light, it's the space that gives it meaning.

When I’m not building systems, I’m sculpting sound.

I make synthwave, doom metal, and experimental noise. I believe that code and music come from the same root: structure, rhythm, and emotion.

Let’s build something sharp, fast, and real.
Whether it’s infra, data, or something darker, reach out!
