# Design systems with soul in code, in sound, in silence

I’m Adrián Villanueva Martínez, a Spanish software engineer and multidisciplinary artist currently based in Japan.

My main area of interest is building things that make life better and provide value to the users and the world. I believe technology and creativity together can shape a more thoughtful, livable world.

My background is rooted in data engineering, cloud architecture, and emerging technologies, but my curiosity doesn’t stop there. I’m equally drawn to the organic flow of hydroponics, the mechanical poetry of robotics, the transcendence of art, and the timeless questions posed by philosophy.

These diverse interests fuel my work and worldview. I see no hard lines between disciplines, only connections waiting to be made.

I am drawn to different artistical fields such as music, photography and tattoing.

Travel is another source of creative energy. It gives me perspective, cultural fluency, and the humility to always remain a student of the world.

## 🌀 Working Philosophy

> _“Resilience in architecture. Elegance in code. Meaning in structure.”_

I believe software is more than just tools, it's ritual, rhythm, and responsibility. I take pride of my work, my systems are designed to scale, to last, and to honor the flow between logic and intuition.

- Simplicity over complexity
- Speed over bureaucracy
- Taste over trend
- The right tool for the right solution
- Trust and elevate your teammates

I dislike Kubernetes bloat. I build fast, scalable systems that stay maintainable

## 🎯 Currently Exploring

- DAWs, different synthesizers and instruments
- LLM agents and integrations
- Rust
- Systems, self hosting and observability

## 🖤 A Little More Human

By day, I build pipelines.
By night, I channel frequencies.
I believe darkness is not the absence of light, it's the space that gives it meaning.

When I’m not building systems, I’m sculpting sound.

I make synthwave, doom metal, and experimental noise. I believe that code and music come from the same root: structure, rhythm, and emotion.

Let’s build something sharp, fast, and real.
Whether it’s infra, data, or something darker, reach out!
