## ▲ Now ▲

I am writing this from my cozy apartment in Tokyo.

### 💻 Primary Mission `[ACTIVE]`

I am going to try boxing soon for the first time and I feel excited about that. My goal is to use this as a way to gain more discipline and more mental focus.

### 🎯 Learning Protocol `[IN_PROGRESS]`

I am actively learning more about Zig, I think it is a very interesting language and has some specific language designs that I am liking.

Also I am reading ```Building a second brain``` and ```Communication for engineers```. They are nice books.

I cannot wait longer to get the Thinkpad T480s keyboard replacement

### 🤔 Thinking about or evaluating `[REFLECTION]`

I have 2 long weekends in a row and i am excited to get out of Tokyo, especially during my second weekend, I am planning to do a solo trip to North Japan.

### 📡 TRANSMISSION_NOTES
