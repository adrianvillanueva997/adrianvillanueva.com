## PRIMARY FOCUS

I am writing this from my cozy apartment in Tokyo.

### PHYSICAL TRAINING

I am going to try **boxing** soon for the first time and I feel excited about that. My goal is to use this as a way to gain more discipline and more mental focus.

### LEARNING OBJECTIVES

I am actively learning more about **Zig** â€” I think it is a very interesting language and has some specific language designs that I am liking.

Also I am reading `Building a second brain` and `Communication for engineers`. They are nice books.

I cannot wait longer to get the **Thinkpad T480s** keyboard replacement.

### CURRENT THOUGHTS

I have 2 long weekends in a row and I am excited to get out of Tokyo, especially during my second weekend. I am planning to do a **solo trip to North Japan**.
