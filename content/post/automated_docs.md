Probably one of the most boring tasks in software development is writing documentation. At least in my personal experience no one likes it.
There are a lot of tools for different languages, some are built-in like, for example, javadocs or cargo docs.

For Python there is [docstrings](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/development/contributing_docstring.html)
