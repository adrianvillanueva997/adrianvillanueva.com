## PRIMARY FOCUS

Improving my japanese.

### PHYSICAL TRAINING

Kickboxing is very fun, I want to increase my strength.

### LEARNING OBJECTIVES

Create a proxmox cluster with kubernetes using Talos and bootstrap it with terraform and deploy a LLM in my cluster for learning purposes.

I am reading `Deep work` by Cal Newport.

I have replaced my thinkpad t480s ram, keyboard (JP to English) and the battery. It is a great machine and i am happy with the purchase. However, I wanted to upgrade my gaming laptop RAM but nope. It is too expensive. Thank you AI bubble.

### CURRENT THOUGHTS

Snowy Tokyo is so beautiful and photogenic.
