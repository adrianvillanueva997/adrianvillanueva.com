## PRIMARY FOCUS

I am writing this from my room in Tokyo.

### PHYSICAL TRAINING

I have commited to boxing and tried kickboxing, turns out I enjoy both of them. However I want to fix my training schedule to make it more consistent.

### LEARNING OBJECTIVES

Create a proxmox cluster with kubernetes using Talos and bootstrap it with terraform and deploy a LLM in my cluster for learning purposes.

I am reading `Deep work` by Cal Newport.

I have replaced my thinkpad t480s ram, keyboard (JP to English) and the battery. It is a great machine and i am happy with the purchase. However, I wanted to upgrade my gaming laptop RAM but nope. It is too expensive. Thank you AI bubble.

### CURRENT THOUGHTS

Looking for an apartment in Tokyo is tough, so many alternatives and interesting areas. For now Kagurazaka caught my attention.
